## FLY SWAT GAME ##
Welcome to my Fly Swat Game which I designed and developed using Java Processing! The main of the objective of the player is to save the pumpkin from the bats, once it touches the pumpkin the player looses his/her life. Below you will find the necessary information about the game.
## GAMEPLAY ##
Move the cursor or the mouse to control the player or the scarecrow.

Try to kill the bats before they touch the pumpkin.

Click the mouse button on the flies to kill them.

Avoid killing the white birds, once you try killing them you will lose all your lives and the game will be over.

Try to achieve the highest score until you lose all your lives.
